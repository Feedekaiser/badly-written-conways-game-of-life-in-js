            <h1>What is Conway's Game of Life?</h1>
            <p>
                Conway's Game of Life is "zero-player" game devised in 1970 by the british mathematician John Horton Conway
                that takes place on a grid of cells. Each cell is either "alive" or "dead". The game evolves over time
                <span class="spoiler">or not</span> based on a set of rules.

                <br><br>The rules are simple:
                <ul>
                    <li>If a living cell has 1 or 0 living neighbour, it dies of loneliness. Guess it doesn't pay to be anti-social.</li>
                    <li>If a living cell has more than 3 living neighbour, it dies of overcrowding. I told you they needed some personal space!</li>
                    <li>If a dead cell has exactly 3 living neighbors, it comes to life. Looks like three's company, but four's a crowd - for dead cells, at least.</li>
                </ul>

                The game begins with an initial pattern of living and dead cells, and then the rules are applied over and over
                again to create new patterns. Sometimes these patterns die out quickly, while other times they grow and evolve
                into complex shapes and structures.

            <h1>That sounds boring.</h1>
            <p>
                Hold your horsese before you click off. Did I told you about how there are spaceships, pulsars, guns,
                beehives<span class="spoiler">(what?)</span>, toads, boats and more?
            </p>
            <p>
                "How come?" Well, I lied. <br>
                These are just the names of some patterns that arise from the game. But they are still super cool just to look at.
            </p>
            <p>Just look at pulsar!</p>

            <p>Maybe pulsar isn't all that interesting. How about a glider gun?</p>
